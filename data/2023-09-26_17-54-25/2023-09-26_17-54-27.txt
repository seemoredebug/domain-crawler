Descriptionï¼š
Preferred authentic Xinhui citrus fruit and court-grade Pu'er tea materials, a blend of citrus fruit aroma and Yunnan Pu'er mellow aging aroma. Insist on using semi-raw tanning process to lock the citrus peel nutrition and ripe Pu-erh tea properties. The soup color is red and transparent, and the taste is crisp and sweet, with strong sweetness in the mouth, bringing soothing good mood. Share Share Link
