Prepare the tea set When brewing raw Pu'er tea, you need to prepare a purple clay pot or a tea set with a covered bowl, and boil the water, preferably mountain spring water. After the water boils, wash the tea set first to increase the temperature of the tea set. In order to make the tea aroma purer, it is necessary to moisten the tea before the official brewing and scald the tea leaves with boiling water. 2. Water injection After the preparation is completed, add 5-10g of tea according to personal preference. The fragrance depends on the flushing, the soup depends on the hanging, when the water is poured, the water rushes rapidly, and the aroma is higher, but the tea flavor is sacrificed; when the water is poured, the water is poured slowly at a fixed point, and the taste is denser and softer, but the tea aroma will be sacrificed. 3. Soup Under normal circumstances, each brewing time is 1-3 minutes. The brewed tea soup is filtered into the tea sea, and then divided into the tea cups, and it is appropriate to be 80% full. Smell the fragrance first, observe the brightness and transparency of the tea soup, and then take a sip to experience the charm of raw Pu'er tea. How to Brew Pu'er Ripe Tea 1.

The amount of tea can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences. 3. Wake up tea Pu-erh ripe tea has heavy accumulation of gas. Before brewing, you need to wake up the tea, pour hot water for about 10 seconds and pour it out, and then pour in 100-degree boiling water. The first five brews are 5-7 seconds, and the soup is 7-10 seconds after the sixth brew.

The purple clay pot has a unique air permeability, which can retain the tea fragrance after brewing. The white porcelain cover bowl will highlight the color of the black tea soup and using a glass pot to make the tea can more clearly feel the changes in the tea soup. 2. Dosage of tea The amount of tea poured depends on personal taste and the size of the tea set. Generally, the amount of tea poured is about 5-10 grams. If the amount of tea is too small, the tea soup will be weak, and if the amount of tea is too much, the tea soup will be too thick, which will affect the taste. 3. The water temperature is suitable The best water temperature for brewing black tea is 90-100 \u2103, and it is best to use boiling water that has just boiled bubbles. Use the technique of hanging the pot to raise the top of the teacup, and then pour hot water and 100 \u2103 water into the teacup. When entering the cup, it will drop to around 95\u00b0C. 4. Brewing time Different quality black teas have different brewing times.

How to store Pu'er tea Which improper ways of storing tea will ruin your Pu'er tea? Tea lovers know that Pu-erh tea is particularly hygroscopic and odor-absorbing, and it can easily absorb moisture and odors in the air. If a Pu-erh tea is not stored properly, the Pu-erh tea will lose its flavor and taste in a short period of time. The storage of tea pays attention to certain methods, especially Pu-erh tea. Today, Tea Horse Guotou will talk about which improper storage methods will make tea lose its original taste and reduce its value. Which improper ways of storing tea will ruin your Pu'er tea? First: open air Many tea lovers like to store Pu-erh on a bookshelf or a corner of the living room, but indoor odor, excessively dry or humid air, and ultraviolet rays in sunlight are all enemies of Pu-erh tea aging. If it is the original packaging, it is best not to open it, considering the convenience of storage. If it is a small amount of tea, you can choose purple clay pots, clay pots, and cardboard boxes according to your own conditions. It is best not to use porcelain to seal Pu-erh tea, and oiled clay pots are not the first choice for storage. Some tea products have plastic packaging in their original packaging, but most of them use plastic packaging without affecting the storage of tea, so it is better not to dismantle them. Do not store in tin moon cake boxes or other tin boxes! Second: Mixing raw and cooked foods will contaminate each other and cause odor. Many tea lovers pack Pu\u2019er tea into boxes, but if raw Pu\u2019er tea and cooked Pu\u2019er tea are sealed in the same box, because the aromas of raw and cooked tea are quite different, they will contaminate each other and cause odor. Third: Excessive ventilation Many articles about the storage of Pu-erh tea simply emphasize ventilation, but in fact, excessive ventilation may not only sharply reduce the moisture content of Pu-erh tea, but also stop the post-transformation. If changes occur, the original new tea leaves will disappear, and the old flavor will gradually be revealed. Fourth: Put Pu-erh tea in a place with a peculiar smell. Can not be put together with incense, medicine, cosmetics, etc. I believe that many new tea lovers will hear the old tea friends say that Pu\u2019er tea should be stored in a place that is dry and ventilated, has a constant temperature and is not humid, has no peculiar smell, and is not exposed to the sun, and there should be no incense, medicine, cosmetics, etc. around, let alone. Mix different tea leaves together and save. Anyone who likes aged drinks and food should know that, whether it is wine, medicinal wine, or aged plums, materials and production are important, but storage is even more critical. The influence of different environments and containers cannot be ignored. . Therefore, the storage of aged Pu-erh tea is an important factor affecting the taste. From personal experience, we can summarize the five essentials of tea storage: constant temperature, constant humidity, no light, no miscellaneous smell, and fun. At the same time, avoid improper storage of tea from ruining your Pu'er tea! Origin of Pu'er tea Pu'er tea has a history of more than 2,000 years. This tea is produced in Xishuangbanna, Lincang, Pu'er and other regions in Yunnan. Because this tea has been distributed in Pu'er, it is named Pu'er tea. Pu-erh tea is made from Yunnan large-leaf sun-dried green tea as raw material, which is loose tea or pressed tea after fermentation.
